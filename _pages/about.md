# **Hi, I’m Daniel** 👋 — *Game Developer Extraordinaire*  

Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🎮 It’s awesome to connect with you.

## **How It Started...** 🌟  

I began my professional journey back in **2009** as a 3D Artist at a small studio creating PC retail titles. Over the years, I sharpened my craft in the **browser** and **mobile gaming industries**, collaborating with amazing teams at **Bigpoint** and **InnoGames** in Hamburg, Germany.  

After **8 exciting years** as a 3D Artist (even stepping into senior roles), I realized I wanted to follow my true passion—**programming games in Unity3D**—which I was doing since 2012.  

> “Every journey begins with a single step, and for me, that step was learning to code.”  

I dove headfirst into this challenge, earning my **B.Sc. in Software Engineering** in just 3.5 years while working full-time.

- Joining **Unity Technologies** as a Software Developer, where I spent 2.5 incredible years.  
- Moving on to **Voodoo.io** as a Senior Game Developer, crafting engaging experiences for players worldwide.
