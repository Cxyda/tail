This theme builds upon an amazing theme called [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale). Apart from the minor fixes to Tale, this theme is designed to make it easier to maintain a blog. If you already have a bunch of files in `*.md` format, you can simply copy them to the `_posts` folder after forking this theme and making a few changes to `_config.yml`, your blog is ready to go!

## What's new in Tail
- Dark Mode
- Support for posts without the `YYYY-MM-DD` in post's filename
- Bi-directional Wiki-style linking support compatible with Obsidian (Planned)

## Some great features from the original Tale
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)
- Syntax highlighting, with the help of Pygments
- Markdown and HTML text formatting
- Pagination of posts
- Sticky posts
- Tags
- Excerpt management
- Disqus comments
